### Features:

**Sanjith**: A HUD element showing the current number of lives. Once the number of lives are equal to 0, the time is frozen. Shows a UI screen saying game over. Using a coroutine, transitions to the main menu scene after a short delay of 1.5 seconds. Did the Building for WebGL and exported it to itch.io

**Reyhan**: Added particle effect on ball collision with the brick object, updated GameManager script so that particle is linked to onBrickDestroyed method. Fixed bug where initially lives counter wouldnt reset on game completion, Now once game is completed lives are reset.

**Aadil**: Camera shake element which shakes the camera of the game when the ball destroys a brick. Camera shake has a strength and a duration parameter whose values can be changed to change how strong and long the shake is.

**Varun**: A UI element which displays the current score. The score increments by one upon detecting a collision between the ball and a brick. The score is also maintained between the two levels and resets to 0 upon game completion or losing all lives. A simple animation is added to the score update to make it look like a snappy ease in.
